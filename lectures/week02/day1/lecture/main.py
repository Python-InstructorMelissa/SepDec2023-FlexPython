# Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)

# make 3 var
lowNum = 2
highNum = 9
mult = 3

# start with low through high print values that are multiples of mult
# starting at 2/3  not whole number
# 3/3 is whole

# % lets us see if there is a remainder    if i % 3 = 0  if yes print if not who cares
